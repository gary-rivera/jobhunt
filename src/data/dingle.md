# Full Stack JavaScript Developer Profile

## 4+ Year Career Span

### I am a full stack JavaScript developer with deep expertise in React and Node.js, specializing in API development and performance optimization. My career has been defined by building scalable fintech platforms where I bridge frontend user experiences with robust backend systems.

## Core Identity:

I'm a systems thinker who approaches development holistically - from database optimization and API architecture to frontend performance and user experience. I excel at identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies across the entire stack, then implementing elegant solutions that improve both technical performance and business outcomes.

## Technical Foundation:

My expertise centers on JavaScript/TypeScript with React for frontend development and Node.js/Express for backend services. I'm proficient with SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), AWS infrastructure, and building REST APIs with proper authentication and authorization patterns. I also work comfortably with Docker, Redis, and comprehensive testing frameworks.

## Problem-Solving Approach:

I have a natural inclination toward optimization and consolidation - whether simplifying complex API architectures, enhancing database query performance, or streamlining user workflows. I consistently focus on reducing complexity while improving reliability and performance across systems.

## Collaboration & Growth:

Throughout my career progression from Associate to Core to Full Stack Developer, I've demonstrated strong cross-functional collaboration skills, working effectively with engineering, product, design, and data teams. I take ownership of technical decisions while maintaining clear communication about trade-offs and business impact.

## Domain Expertise:

My experience is rooted in fintech platforms where I understand the critical importance of security, compliance (CCPA), and handling sensitive financial data. I've successfully navigated complex technical challenges like platform migrations, merger integrations, and building systems that handle high-volume financial transactions.
I'm someone who thrives on transforming technical complexity into elegant, maintainable solutions that directly support business growth and user satisfaction.
